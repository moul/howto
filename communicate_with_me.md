# How to communicate with @moul (Manfred Touron)

Hi! Following the example of the venerable [Lucas Di Cioccio](https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio),
and of the admirable [Guillaume Lesur](https://twitter.com/bipbip),
here is a quick summary of how I prefer that you communicate with me,
making my life easier to help you faster.

## Communication media preference

I like to communicate using these media, by order of preference:

1. Email
2. Slack
3. Telegram / Facebook Messenger
4. iMessage / SMS
5. Direct human contact (in person / by phone)
6. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/moul) / [IRC](https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=moul&hostname=irc.freenode.net&port=6697&ssl=1)
